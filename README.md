# Ello Android

Ello's open source Android app.  Written in Kotlin using a custom "Single
Activity" framework that is inspired by UIKit's UIViewController lifecycle, with
a slightly more Android flavor.

## Setup

Nothing much to it.

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:ello/android.git`
- Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
- Follow the setup wizard
  * Standard
    - Use this if you don't already have the SDK downloaded
  * Custom
    1. Use this if you use the android SDK manager or Homebrew for SDK versions
      as you will be able to modify the sdk path and can minimize what will get
      downloaded initially
    - Pick a light/dark theme
    - Select path to an existing sdk like `usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk`
    - Probably go with the recommended emulator settings
    - Finish to download required SDK components
- Open the project folder to install/update gradle

## Notes

When creating the apk to upload to the Google Play Store it must be aligned.
`zipalign -f -v 4 app-release-unaligned.apk app-release-aligned.apk`
